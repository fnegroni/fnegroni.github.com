Hello
-----

My name is Filippo Erik Negroni, and I leave in the UK.

I am a professional software engineer, who believes in open source software and collaboration tools.

I am married, have a son, and do my bit for the environment by commuting to work by bicycle.

The project I am currently working on at the moment is link:linux-sbs-module-fix[Fix for SBS module on Linux].
