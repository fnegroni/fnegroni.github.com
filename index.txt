For the impatient
-----------------
To obtain a copy, you must download the files published in http://sourceforge.net/projects/eweb/files/[the sourceforge Files area].

You can also visit http://www.sf.net/projects/eweb[our project's page on sourceforge.net] where you will find additional resources such as our Git repository, a bug and feature tracker, and can ask for help or discuss topics on our forums. 


What is it?
-----------
With eWEB you can weave and tangle literate programs written as AsciiDoc documents, using embedded WEB code snippets.

The entire program is written in AsciiDoc, and the code parts (known as code snippets) are written within listing blocks.

A literate program written in eWEB format is a perfectly formed AsciiDoc document. Should eWEB disappear as a tool, the original document is still perfectly rendered by AsciiDoc. AsciiDoc documents themselves are also perfectly readable in source form.

At the core of eWEB there are two tools: link:etangle.html[Etangle] and link:eweave.html[Eweave].

Etangle extracts and reorders the code snippets found in the program document. It produces source code modules which can then be processed by your application development toolchain.

Eweave inserts hyperlinks within the code snippets so that the rendered code snippets can be cross referenced by your readers.
