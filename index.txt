Hello
-----

My name is Filippo Erik Negroni, and I leave in the UK.

I am a professional software engineer, who believes in open source software and collaboration tools.

I am married, have a son, and do my bit for the environment by commuting to work by bicycle.

I am currently working on Sugo, a unit test framework for system routines.
